# PartPile-UI

PartPile-UI is an MVP for a sleek inventory management system tailored for computer workshops. It focuses on a user-friendly, Instagram-style interface for easy viewing and managing of computer parts inventory.

## Features

User Authentication: Secure login with email/password, Google, and Microsoft accounts via Firebase.

Responsive UI: View and manage inventory seamlessly across devices, built with Preact and TailwindCSS.

Interactive Inventory Management: Scroll through a grid of items and manage your inventory with a headless CMS backend (coming soon).

## CLI Commands

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# test the production build locally
npm run serve

# run tests with jest and enzyme
npm run test
```
